# ExploringQCâš›

A uncool approach to learn the dark arts of quantum computing [__Just Logs of what I am upto or mess up__]

### Short term goals:
<p align = "center"><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/daasWol3l8f155ITtr/giphy.gif" height = 50% width = 50%></p>

- Grasp the math ahead of the foundations
- Key Terminologies
- Relate to high school physics days
- Take psuedo inspiration from Neil DeGrasse Tyson
- Learn QisKit
- Build cute projects. Quite a lot that one can fill the resume with but after a month won't be worth it
- Understand why on earth do we need QuantumML? 
- Or QuantumCV?
- Revise basics of applied cryptography
- TensorFlowQuantum
- Use IBM and DWave Systems
- Build an end to end project
- Teach 5 people 
- Be satisfied enough to add Quantum Computing as a skill on LinkedIN
- Quantum Open Source

### Day 1:

- How do we understand Quantum Computing?
- What does Quantum Mechanics say about the state of a system?
     - Revisit: Schodinger's cat
- What is superposition 
   - What is linear combination
- Example of superposition: Polariation of light
   - Revisit: Basics of Electromagnetic waves
   - Revisit: Polarized vs Unpolarized Light
   - Revisit: Polarization
- An extended case of the above:
     1. Case A: the first filter is horizontal, second is vertical, what light do you see?
     2. Case B: the first filter is horizontal, second is vertical, what light do you see
- Born's rule --> `the modulus square of the amplitude of a state is equal to the probability of its' occurence after measurement`
- EPR (Einstein Pdolsky Rosen) Paradox
- Weird concept of entanglement, "spooky action at a distance"
- Interpretation in information theory
- Physical limitation of the speed and compactness of computing circuit in terms of energy dissipated --> Lauder's Bound 
- Irreversibility ( base definition in terms of information theory) --> `If the output cannot explicitly define the input of the system`
     - Revisit Second Law of Thermodynamics
           - Revisit Entropy
           - Revisit First Law of Thermodynamics
- Classical Computing Irreversible Operation example (Simply an OR/AND GATE)
- Quantum Computers should have reversible logical information --> No measurement is lost implying no information is lost
