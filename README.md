A uncool approach to learn the dark arts of quantum computing [__Just Logs of what I am upto or mess up__]

### Short term goals:
<p align = "center"><img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/daasWol3l8f155ITtr/giphy.gif" height = 50% width = 50%></p>

- Grasp the math ahead of the foundations
- Key Terminologies
- Relate to high school physics days
- Take psuedo inspiration from Neil DeGrasse Tyson
- Learn QisKit
- Build cute projects. Quite a lot that one can fill the resume with but after a month won't be worth it
- Understand why on earth do we need QuantumML? 
- Or QuantumCV?
- Revise basics of applied cryptography
- TensorFlowQuantum
- Use IBM and DWave Systems
- Build an end to end project
- Teach 5 people 
- Be satisfied enough to add Quantum Computing as a skill on LinkedIN
- Quantum Open Source
